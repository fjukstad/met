# met
Get data from [data.met.no](http://data.met.no). Note that both the MET API and
this package are still in development. 

# Setup
Before you can use the met package you'll have to request client credentials
from data.met.no [here](https://data.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html), and
store them in an environment variable `CLIENT_ID`. 

# Acknowledgements
